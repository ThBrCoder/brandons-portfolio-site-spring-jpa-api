        <p>In my spare time from being a Java developer, I like to watch movies, funny YouTube videos, and collecting video games. One of the systems I enjoy playing the most is my old, trusty Nintendo 64.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">The most daunting task I have ever accomplished was plan my first trip out of the country, without a guide, to Japan in 2019. It lasted for two weeks, and I visited Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, Osaka, Ise, Nara and Nagoya. It took a lot of planning, and a lot of navigation help from Google Maps.</p>
